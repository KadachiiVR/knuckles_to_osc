# Knuckles to OSC
A simple program that sends raw Knuckles controller inputs (trackpad, finger pose, etc) to an OSC receiver of your choosing, presumably VRChat. You can use this to do things like drive expressions without needing to use the typical hand gestures!

(This is just a cursory readme to get started, more detail to come)

## Instructions
- Download the .zip from [the latest release](https://github.com/KadachiiVR/knuckles_to_osc/releases/tag/v0.1)
- Unzip it
- Start SteamVR
- Run `Knuckles_to_OSC.exe` in the unzipped folder

You'll see a command-line window showing the avatar parameters that the program is trying to send OSC data to. You can use those parameters in your avatar animator to drive anything you want.
